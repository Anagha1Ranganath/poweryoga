                        <div class="col-9"><h3>Erica Schommer</h3><p>Drawn to yoga as a child, the practice felt intuitively healing for Erica.  A born and raised Jersey girl, Erica graduated with a Bachelors of Science in psychology from University of Maryland College Park , and a Master of Arts in mental health therapy from Boston College.  She pursued her yoga teacher training to integrate asana (poses), pranayama (breathwork), and meditation (mindfulness) into mental health therapy treatments.  During the training, she felt immediately connected to the philosophy, and recognized its potential universal application.  She currently holds a professional license in the state of Maryland (LCPC), and is a registered experienced yoga teacher with Yoga Alliance (E-RYT 200).  Erica has experience working in both fields with young children, adolescents, and adults from various backgrounds and cultures.  Her intention for classes and teacher training is to bring yoga into the hearts of others as more than just a physical practice.  She enjoys exploring postures through thematic sequencing, emphasizing alignment and balance, and weaving in elements of yoga philosophy to nurture the mind, body, and spirit.  Trust, compassion, humor, and non-attachment are values she strives to embody whether in the studio, at home, in a park, or on the dance floor.  Grateful for each moment, Erica holds this practice and lifestyle close to her heart, and is thrilled to share it with you.</p></div>

                        <div class="col-9"><h3>Michelle Devore</h3><p>Michelle Zuniga's love for yoga began when she personally realized the many physical and mental benefits a regular practice brings. Not long after she began a consistent yoga practice, she enrolled in her first 200hr teacher-training program to learn how to share these benefits with others. Michelle has completed a 200 hour training in Power Yinyasa as well as a 200 hour training in Traditional Hot Yoga. She completed her 500 hr certification in November 2016 and has thousands of hours of teaching experience. Michelle's teaching ranges from chair yoga and gentle flows to advanced vinyasa yoga.

This will be Michelle's 6th year assisting and leading out in an RYS training program.</p></div>

                        <div class="col-9"><h3>Jason Herd</h3><p>Jason Herd, a co-founder of M.Power, has been teaching yoga for over 10 years. He was originally drawn to the deeper roots of the practice: the breath, meditation and the philosophy of yoga. He initially used yoga to supplement other workouts like lifting weights and cardio and it provided him the benefits of a calm and present mind. After discovering the challenge of Power Yoga, that all changed. Yoga quickly became his workout of choice, and the deeper practice took a back seat. After many yoga induced injuries caused by classes that pushed the envelope without regard to safe guarding the body, Jason has returned to his roots and what originally drew him to the practice. He is currently studying with one of the most experienced and respected Yoga teachers in the West, Rod Stryker. Jason designs his classes to give you the workout you are looking for while introducing you to the essential techniques that respect your body's limits so you can enjoy a lifetime of yoga: alignment, breath, and a present and still mind.</p></div>

His mission in life is to accompany others through their darker moments using the marriage of spiritual study, psychology and a healthy dose of laughter to help reframe and shed light on his students' and clients' situations.
